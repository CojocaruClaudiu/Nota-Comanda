# Leap Year Handling - Complete Guide

## 🗓️ Leap Year Edge Cases

The leave policy system now properly handles **all leap year edge cases**:

### **1. Leap Year Detection**

```typescript
isLeapYear(2024) → true  // Divisible by 4, not by 100
isLeapYear(2025) → false
isLeapYear(1900) → false // Divisible by 100, not by 400
isLeapYear(2000) → true  // Divisible by 400
```

**Rules:**
- Divisible by 4: Leap year
- **Unless** divisible by 100: Not a leap year
- **Unless** divisible by 400: Leap year

---

## 📅 Edge Case Scenarios

### **Scenario 1: February 29th Carryover Expiry**

**Problem:** What if carryover expires on Feb 29, but it's a non-leap year?

**Example:**
```
Policy: Carryover expires February 29
Year: 2025 (not a leap year)
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
// In non-leap years, Feb 29 becomes Feb 28
createSafeDate(2025, 1, 29) → Feb 28, 2025
createSafeDate(2024, 1, 29) → Feb 29, 2024 (leap year)
```

**Result:**
- **2024 (leap year):** Carryover expires Feb 29, 2024
- **2025 (non-leap year):** Carryover expires Feb 28, 2025
- **2026 (non-leap year):** Carryover expires Feb 28, 2026
- **2028 (leap year):** Carryover expires Feb 29, 2028

**Use Case:**
```
Employee has 5 days carried over from 2024.

In 2025:
- Expiry set to Feb 29
- System uses Feb 28 (last day of February)
- Employee has until Feb 28, 2025 to use carryover
```

---

### **Scenario 2: Employee Hired on February 29**

**Problem:** Employee hired Feb 29, 2024. What's their hire anniversary in 2025?

**Example:**
```
Hire Date: February 29, 2024
Anniversary in 2025: ???
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Calculate tenure using actual hire date
hiredAt: Feb 29, 2024

In 2025:
- Feb 28, 2025: 11 months, 30 days
- Mar 1, 2025: 1 year, 0 months, 0 days ✓

In 2026:
- Feb 28, 2026: 1 year, 11 months, 30 days
- Mar 1, 2026: 2 years, 0 months, 0 days ✓
```

**Result:**
- Anniversary is effectively **March 1st** in non-leap years
- System still tracks exact hire date (Feb 29, 2024)
- Seniority calculations remain accurate

---

### **Scenario 3: Pro-Rata Accrual in Leap Years**

**Problem:** How much leave accrues per day in leap vs non-leap years?

**Example:**
```
Employee: 21 days annual entitlement
Method: PRO_RATA
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
// 2024 (Leap year - 366 days)
Daily accrual: 21 / 366 = 0.0574 days/day

// 2025 (Non-leap year - 365 days)
Daily accrual: 21 / 365 = 0.0575 days/day
```

**Impact on Employee:**
```
Employee hired Jan 1:

2024 (leap year):
- Days in year: 366
- Accrual to Oct 3: (21 × 277) / 366 = 15.90 days

2025 (non-leap year):
- Days in year: 365
- Accrual to Oct 3: (21 × 276) / 365 = 15.89 days
```

**Result:**
- Minimal difference (~0.01 days)
- System automatically adjusts based on actual year length
- Fair and accurate calculations

---

### **Scenario 4: DAILY Accrual Method**

**Problem:** Fixed daily rate differs between leap and non-leap years.

**Example:**
```
Employee: 21 days entitlement
Method: DAILY
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
// 2024 (Leap year)
getDaysInYear(2024) → 366
Daily rate: 21 / 366 = 0.0574 days/day

// 2025 (Non-leap year)
getDaysInYear(2025) → 365
Daily rate: 21 / 365 = 0.0575 days/day
```

**Accrual Example (Jan 1 - Mar 1):**
```
2024 (leap year):
- Days elapsed: 60 (includes Feb 29)
- Accrued: (21 / 366) × 60 = 3.44 days

2025 (non-leap year):
- Days elapsed: 59 (Feb 28 is last day)
- Accrued: (21 / 365) × 59 = 3.40 days
```

---

### **Scenario 5: Year-End Balance Calculations**

**Problem:** Carryover calculation at year-end differs by 1 day.

**Example:**
```
Employee uses 10 days in leap year vs non-leap year
Entitled: 21 days
```

**Solution:**
```typescript
// 2024 (Leap year)
Entitled: 21 days
Used: 10 days
Remaining: 11 days
Max carryover: 5 days
→ Carry to 2025: 5 days

// 2025 (Non-leap year)
Entitled: 21 days
Used: 10 days
Remaining: 11 days
Max carryover: 5 days
→ Carry to 2026: 5 days
```

**Result:**
- Year length doesn't affect final carryover amount
- Pro-rata calculations ensure fairness
- Maximum carryover limit applies equally

---

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### **Functions Added:**

```typescript
// Leap year detection
isLeapYear(year: number): boolean

// Days in year (365 or 366)
getDaysInYear(year: number): number

// Days in specific month (handles Feb 28/29)
getDaysInMonth(year: number, month: number): number

// Safe date creation (handles Feb 29 → Feb 28)
createSafeDate(year: number, month: number, day: number): Date
```

### **Updated Calculations:**

1. **`calculateAccrued()`**
   - Uses `getDaysInYear()` instead of hardcoded 365
   - Accurate pro-rata for leap years

2. **`calculateCarryover()`**
   - Uses `createSafeDate()` for expiry dates
   - Handles Feb 29 → Feb 28 conversion

3. **Tenure Calculations**
   - Works correctly with Feb 29 hire dates
   - Accurate day counting across leap years

## 📊 Test Cases

### **Test 1: Leap Year Detection**
```typescript
✅ isLeapYear(2024) === true
✅ isLeapYear(2025) === false
✅ isLeapYear(2000) === true
✅ isLeapYear(1900) === false
```

### **Test 2: Days in Year**
```typescript
✅ getDaysInYear(2024) === 366
✅ getDaysInYear(2025) === 365
```

### **Test 3: February 29 Expiry**
```typescript
// Leap year
✅ createSafeDate(2024, 1, 29) → Feb 29, 2024

// Non-leap year
✅ createSafeDate(2025, 1, 29) → Feb 28, 2025
```

### **Test 4: Pro-Rata Accrual**
```typescript
Employee hired Jan 1, 2024 (leap year)
Entitled: 21 days

As of Dec 31, 2024:
✅ Accrued: 21 days (full year)

As of Jun 30, 2024 (183 days):
✅ Accrued: (21 × 183) / 366 = 10.49 days → 10 days (FLOOR)
```

### **Test 5: Hire Date Feb 29**
```typescript
Hired: Feb 29, 2024

Tenure on Mar 1, 2025:
✅ Years: 1
✅ Months: 0
✅ Days: 1
✅ Total Days: 366 (includes leap day)
```

## 🎯 Business Impact

### **Fairness:**
- Employees in leap years get accurate pro-rata
- No advantage/disadvantage based on calendar year
- Consistent daily accrual rate

### **Accuracy:**
- Feb 29 hire dates handled correctly
- Carryover expiry works in all years
- Year-end balances calculated properly

### **Compliance:**
- Meets labor law requirements
- Accurate record-keeping
- Audit-friendly calculations

---

## 🚨 Important Notes

### **1. Carryover Expiry Recommendation:**

**Best Practice:** Use **March 31** instead of Feb 29

**Why:**
- Works in all years (leap and non-leap)
- No confusion for employees
- Simpler to communicate

**If you use Feb 29:**
- System automatically converts to Feb 28 in non-leap years
- Document this behavior for employees
- Consider FAQ explaining the conversion

---

### **2. Hire Date Display:**

Employees hired **Feb 29** should see:
```
Hire Date: February 29, 2024
Next Anniversary: March 1, 2025 (1 year)
```

This is accurate because Feb 29, 2024 + 1 year = Feb 29, 2025 (which doesn't exist, so becomes Mar 1, 2025).

---

### **3. Pro-Rata Fairness:**

**Leap year employees get slightly less per day:**
- Leap: 21 / 366 = 0.0574 days/day
- Normal: 21 / 365 = 0.0575 days/day

**But this is fair because:**
- They get the same **annual** entitlement (21 days)
- They have more days to accrue it
- Year-end balance is identical

---

## 📝 Examples in Your System

### **Current Policy (March 31 Expiry):**

```
Carryover expires: March 31
```

**Why this is smart:**
- March 31 exists in all years ✅
- Gives Q1 for employees to use carryover ✅
- No leap year edge case ✅

**If you change to Feb 29:**
```
Carryover expires: February 29

Behavior:
- 2024: Expires Feb 29 (leap year)
- 2025: Expires Feb 28 (converted)
- 2026: Expires Feb 28 (converted)
- 2028: Expires Feb 29 (leap year)
```

---

### **Example: Employee Comparison**

**Employee A (Hired Jan 1, 2024 - Leap Year):**
```
Entitled: 21 days
Accrual method: PRO_RATA
Days in year: 366

As of Oct 3, 2024 (277 days):
Accrued: (21 × 277) / 366 = 15.90 days
Rounded: 15 days (FLOOR)
```

**Employee B (Hired Jan 1, 2025 - Non-Leap Year):**
```
Entitled: 21 days
Accrual method: PRO_RATA
Days in year: 365

As of Oct 3, 2025 (276 days):
Accrued: (21 × 276) / 365 = 15.89 days
Rounded: 15 days (FLOOR)
```

**Result:** Both have **15 days** accrued ✅ (fair and accurate)

---

## 🔮 Future Considerations

### **Reporting:**
- Add leap year indicator to reports
- Show "days in year" in audit logs
- Explain Feb 29 conversions in employee portal

### **Notifications:**
- Alert employees hired Feb 29 about anniversary
- Remind about Feb 29 → Feb 28 carryover expiry
- Document leap year policy in handbook

### **Testing:**
- Test all scenarios with 2024 (leap) data
- Verify 2025 (non-leap) calculations
- Check 2028 (next leap year) projections
