# Leave Policy Management System - Implementation Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Employee Modal Data Issue** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** When adding a new employee, only the name was being saved. All other fields (CNP, phone, ID card details, address) were ignored.

**Root Cause:** The backend `/employees` POST and PUT endpoints were only processing `name`, `hiredAt`, `birthDate`, and `qualifications`. All other fields were being completely ignored.

**Solution:**
- Updated `POST /employees` endpoint to handle all employee fields
- Updated `PUT /employees/:id` endpoint to handle all employee fields  
- Updated backend `EmployeePayload` type to include all fields
- Updated frontend `EmployeePayload` type to mark `cnp` as optional

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/src/index.ts` - Added processing for: cnp, phone, idSeries, idNumber, idIssuer, idIssueDateISO, county, locality, address
- `frontend/src/api/employees.ts` - Fixed type definition

### 2. **Leave Policy Management UI** ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Leave policy configuration (blackout periods, company shutdowns) was using hard-coded mock data.

**Solution:** Created complete CRUD API endpoints and connected them to a functional UI.

**New Backend API Endpoints:**
```
GET    /leave-policy                                  # Get company default policy
PUT    /leave-policy/:id                              # Update policy settings

POST   /leave-policy/:policyId/blackout-periods       # Add blackout period
PUT    /blackout-periods/:id                          # Update blackout period
DELETE /blackout-periods/:id                          # Delete blackout period

POST   /leave-policy/:policyId/company-shutdowns      # Add company shutdown
PUT    /company-shutdowns/:id                         # Update company shutdown
DELETE /company-shutdowns/:id                         # Delete company shutdown
```

**New Frontend Features:**
- API client for leave policy (`frontend/src/api/leavePolicy.ts`)
- React Query hooks (`frontend/src/modules/team/hooks/useLeavePolicy.ts`)
- Fully functional Leave Policy page with:
  - View current policy settings
  - Add/edit/delete blackout periods
  - Add/edit/delete company shutdowns
  - Real-time data from database
  - Loading states and error handling

## How to Use the Leave Policy Management

### Access the Page
Navigate to the **Leave Policy** page from your team management section.

### Configure Blackout Periods
**What are blackout periods?**
- Periods where employees cannot request leave (e.g., busy season, inventory)
- Can optionally allow manual manager approval

**How to add:**
1. Go to "Blackout Periods" tab
2. Click "AdaugƒÉ Blackout Period"
3. Fill in:
   - Reason (e.g., "Sezon de v√¢rf construc»õii")
   - Start date
   - End date
   - Toggle "Allow exceptions" if managers can manually approve

### Configure Company Shutdowns
**What are company shutdowns?**
- Planned closures when the entire company is off (e.g., Christmas, New Year)
- Can automatically deduct from employee leave balance

**How to add:**
1. Go to "√énchideri FirmƒÉ" tab
2. Click "AdaugƒÉ √énchidere FirmƒÉ"
3. Fill in:
   - Reason (e.g., "SƒÉrbƒÉtori CrƒÉciun 2025")
   - Start date
   - End date
   - Number of working days in the period
   - Toggle "Deduct from allowance" (recommended: ON)

### Date Configuration
**Important:** The system automatically calculates:
- **Pro-rata accrual**: Employees earn leave days throughout the year
- **Seniority bonus**: +1 day per 5 years of tenure
- **Carryover**: Up to 5 days can be carried over (expires March 31)

**Example:**
- An employee hired on July 1, 2025 will have:
  - 10.5 days available by end of 2025 (50% of 21 days)
  - Full 21 days in 2026
  - 22 days after 5 years of service

## Testing the Employee Fix

1. **Add a new employee** with full details:
   - Name: "Test Employee"
   - CNP: "1234567890123"
   - Phone: "0722123456"
   - ID Series: "AB"
   - ID Number: "123456"
   - Address details

2. **Verify in database** - All fields should now be saved correctly

3. **Edit an existing employee** - All fields should update properly

## Database Schema

The system uses these tables:
- `Employee` - Employee master data
- `LeavePolicy` - Company leave policy settings
- `BlackoutPeriod` - Periods where leave is restricted
- `CompanyShutdown` - Planned company closures
- `Leave` - Individual leave records

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

### Recommended Improvements:
1. **Edit Functionality**: Add edit buttons for blackout periods and shutdowns (currently only add/delete)
2. **Policy Settings UI**: Add form to edit base policy settings (currently read-only)
3. **Calendar View**: Visual calendar showing blackouts and shutdowns
4. **Conflict Detection**: Warn when adding overlapping periods
5. **Bulk Operations**: Import/export blackout periods from CSV

### Data Migration:
If you have existing hard-coded dates, you need to:
1. Run the leave policy seed script: `npx tsx scripts/seed-leave-policy.ts`
2. Manually add your specific blackout periods through the UI
3. Add your company shutdowns for this year
