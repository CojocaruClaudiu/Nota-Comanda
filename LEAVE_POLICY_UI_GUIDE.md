## 📋 Overview

The Leave Policy System is now **fully deployed** with a comprehensive UI for managing all aspects of employee leave, blackout periods, and company shutdowns. This document explains all the features and how to use them.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Leave Policy Management Page** 
**URL:** `/leave-policy` (Admin/Manager only)

This is your **control center** for all leave policy settings. Access it at:
```
http://localhost:5173/leave-policy
```

#### **Tab 1: Politică Generală** (General Policy)

Configure the core leave policy rules:

- **Base Configuration:**
  - Base annual days: **21 days/year**
  - Seniority bonus: **+1 day every 5 years**
  - Example: 7-year employee = 22 days (21 base + 1 bonus)

- **Accrual Method:** `PRO_RATA` (recommended)
  - Days accumulate proportionally throughout the year
  - Employee hired July 1st = 50% of annual entitlement until year-end
  - Other options: DAILY, MONTHLY, AT_YEAR_START

- **Carryover Rules:**
  - ✅ **Allowed:** Maximum **5 days** can be carried over
  - ⏰ **Expiry:** Carried days expire on **March 31st**
  - ⚠️ **Warning:** Unused carried days are lost after expiry date

- **Restrictions & Limits:**
  - **Max consecutive:** 10 days (prevents long absences)
  - **Min notice:** 14 days (advance planning required)
  - **Negative balance:** Not allowed (no borrowing)
  - **Rounding:** FLOOR (conservative, rounds down)
